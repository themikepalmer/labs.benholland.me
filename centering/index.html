		<li>Uncertainty is the only certainty there is</li>
		<li>Life is like a ten-speed bicycle. Most of us have gears we never use.</li>
		<li>Fear is only as deep as the mind allows</li>
		<li>Remember, today is the tomorrow you worried about yesterday.</li>
		<li>Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one's courage</li>
		<li>Some people develop a wishbone where their back bone should be.</li>
		<li>There is a tide in the affairs of men</li>
		<li>Be creative. Use unconventional thinking. And have the guts to carry it out.</li>
		<li>Do what you feel in your heart to be right - for you'll be criticized anyway.</li>
		<li>The better I get, the more I realize how much better I can get.</li>
		<li>Be the change you wish to see in the world</li>
		<li>I've got all the money I'll ever need, if I die by four o'clock.</li>
		<li>Everyone is entitled to their own incorrect opinion.</li>
