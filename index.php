			<h3><a href="notes/">Notes</a></h3>
			<a href="notes/"><img src="images/notes.jpg" alt=""></a>
			<p>Part of my <a href="http://benholland.me/news/my-90-minutes-challenge-the-result/">90 Minute Challenge</a>, <strong>Notes</strong> is a simple application that lets you user write a note, check it as done and remove it. The list <strong>automatically saves to a cookie</strong> on the user's system so the next time they open the webpage, there list can be retrieved.</p>
			<p>Further development would be to allow the user to login, adding more privacy to the user's notes. Also, I would like <strong>add customisation</strong> for the colour of the notes.</p>

			<h3><a href="pinterest/">Pinterest</a></h3>
			<p>The realisation of how Pinterest and the <a href="http://benholland.me/javascript/create-magical-layouts-with-isotope-a-great-jquery-plugin/">jQuery plugin Isotope</a> work hit me one night, as a sort of epiphany. So I decided to re-create the effect (resize the page and you'll notice).</p>
			<p>You can read <a href="http://benholland.me/javascript/how-to-build-a-site-that-works-like-pinterest/">how I acheived the Pinterest effect here</a></p>

			<h3><a href="http://benholland.me/demo/visualiser/visualiser-style.html">Music Visuliser</a></h3>
			<a href="http://benholland.me/demo/visualiser/visualiser-style.html"><img src="images/music-visualiser.jpg" alt=""></a>
			<p>This was one of the first <strong>tutorials</strong> I wrote and I feel is one of my best. The <strong>music visualiser</strong> was built to give the impression that it was responded to music being played in the background.</p>
			<p>Performance is good when on it's own, but combined with other animations or heavy plugins then it becomes very sluggish. I would like to go back and see if there's a <strong>more efficient</strong> way to build this.</p>

			<h3><a href="http://www.slidorion.com">Slidorion</a></h3>
			<a href="http://www.slidorion.com"><img src="images/slidorion.jpg" alt=""></a>
			<p><strong>Slidorion</strong> is my creation I am most proud of. Having receieved an overwhelming <strong>18,000 unique visitors</strong> in it's first month, Slidorion has done better than I could have imagined. With the help of many people in the web industry, it has become less buggy and easier to use.</p>
			<p>Currently I am developing a <strong>fullscreen</strong> version of Slidorion. This should hopefully be available in the coming weeks</p>

			<h3><a href="http://www.tidydesign.com/free-backlink-checker/">Backlink Checker</a></h3>
			<a href="http://www.tidydesign.com/free-backlink-checker/"><img src="images/backlink-checker.jpg" alt=""></a>
			<p>An application I developed at <strong>Tidy Design</strong>, a <a href="http://www.tidydesign.com" target="_blank">web design company in Hampshire</a>, the backlink checker uses the SEOmoz API to access the <a href="http://www.opensiteexplorer.org">Open Site Explorer</a> and retrieve data about an inputted URL.</p>
			<p>I hadn't had much experience with API's before this project, but the skills I gained from developing this were pricless. I would love the add more features at a later date.</p>

		<div class="project">
			<h3>Chat</h3>
			<img src="images/construction.jpg" alt="">
			<p>Chat was a idea that stemmed from the creation of <strong>Notes</strong>, using its code as a solid platform to build from.</p>
			<p>I wanted to develop a single page chat that works <strong>across all browsers and platforms</strong>, where you visit the site, creating a unique page, and have the ability to invite others to join the chat. This will hopefully <strong>work with large groups</strong>.</p>
			<p>Currently under construction. Will be ready soon (I hope)</p>

			<h3><a href="http://www.tidydesign.com/website-calculator/web-designers-london.php">Website Calculator</a></h3>
			<a href="http://www.tidydesign.com/website-calculator/web-designers-london.php"><img src="images/website-calculator.jpg" alt=""></a>
			<p>The website calculator was an application I built at <strong>Tidy Design</strong>, a <a href="http://www.tidydesign.com" target="_blank">web design company in Hampshire</a>. The specification was to build a calculator that was contained to one page and was <strong>simple for the user to use</strong>. The calculator was built by hand and had full validation across all different types of fields.</p>
			<p>This was a <strong>really cool application</strong> to build, especially because we got to set the prices on the calculator :D</p>
